## P3

- package a demo image to the user.
- Errors are not being propagated properly to the user
- Spinner doesn't get killed even if you Ctrl+C?
- Need "clear" command in cli.
- Add README for devs who want to get into the code because it's a mess to understand.
- The code is not readable at all.
- A lot of code that does different things has similar naming.
- There seems to be some redundant code. Investigate.
